    <td><h1>About New Life Phones Etc.</h1>
    <p>&emsp;New Life Phones Etc. is the work of Dialigui Ndao (pronounced "jah-lee-gee endow"), or Pape (pronounced "pop"). Pape moved to Pendleton from Senegal, West Africa, where he worked as an electrician. At New Life, he offers a range of related services.<br><br>
    &emsp;In Senegal, Pape is a formally trained, experienced electrician. He has certificates in industrial and building electricity and has experience in new construction and working with existing wiring. As he works to get professional certification in the United States, he enjoys any opportunity to do smaller handyman electric projects. His experience in Senegal has prepared him well for working on older building here, which can be a puzzle of many layers of work done at different times by different people. He's great at solving problems that other electricians don't want to deal with. <br><br>
    &emsp;New Life began with cell phone and electronic device repair. Pape can fix your mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other electronic devices. He can also repair household electronics such as power tools, washers & dryers, microwaves, and more.<br><br>
    &emsp;Having grown up in a developing country, Pape appreciates the importance of repairing devices to get the most out of them. His family's village, like many in Senegal, has no access to electricity, so using renewable energy to provide electricity is a passion of his. He designed and built solar charging stations from recycled materials that can charge multiple cell phones via USB and also have standard A/C outlets. This saves his family members from traveling to the next village to charge their phones. It's great for camping, too!</p>
